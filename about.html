                       <p>As of 2021 I started my journey into software development by becoming a student at ROC Mondriaan in the Hague. After a year of HTML and PHP lessons and an internship at a software development company I knew that this was the path that I wanted to go down. <br><br>

                           From everything I can do with HTML and PHP, CSS is still my favorite as I can make something out of a bland, lifeless, black and white page. Even though I am not in any way an artist, I find great satisfaction in making a good layout with a color scheme that I am proud of. <br><br>

                           My biggest accomplishment so far must be the small independent business that I have started from scratch. I started a small 3d print on demand business back in 2020 as a way to make my 3d printing hobby sustainable. For now my 3d printing business is still in its infancy as a side hobby but I am planning on expanding it with the help of my website making skills. <br><br>

                           As I am now studying to sharpen my skills, I therefore only have the opportunity to take on small projects. For the next couple of years my time will mostly be taken up by my studies, however, it will not always be so. Therefore, feel free to establish contact.
